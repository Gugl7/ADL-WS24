# Assignment 3 - Deliver

## Structure

- `app.py`: Demo Application built in python using streamlit library to showcase the results from the previous assignment.
- `report.pdf`: A final report of what was done in the project.
- `presentation_link.txt`: Link to the youtube video where the presentation was uploaded.
- `requirements.txt`: list of requirements of what is necessary to run the demo app.

## How to run demo app

First step is to install the required libraries using `requirements.txt`. What is also necessary is creating the folder `layoutlm_model` with the model from the previous assignment (it can be downloaded from github releases). After this, typing the command `streamlit run app.py` in console from the folder `A3` should start the app.
