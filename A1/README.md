### References to at least two scientific papers that are related to your topic

1. **A Study of The OCR Development History and Directions of Development** by Jun-miao Wang

2. **Computer Vision Intelligence Test Modeling and Generation: A Case Study on Smart OCR** by Jing Shu, Bing-Jiun Miu, Eugene Chang Gao

### A decision of a topic of your choice

Text recognition (OCR) for receipts.


### A decision of which type of project you want to do

Bring your own method.

### Summary

**a.** For this project I plan to create an OCR model to translate images of receipts to computer text.
**b.** Dataset that I plan to use: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/ocr-receipts-text-detection.
**c.** *Dataset collection:* Downloading the data from the given link, preprocessing it and preparing it for use. This step shouldn't take long since I will used already collected data, including preprocessing: 1 day

*Designing and building an appropriate network:* Using state of the art model with certain tweaks to prepare it for my exact task. This step should take longer, since it should be techinically most complex, approximately 3 weeks

*Training and fine-tuning that network:* Using the designed network to train it on the preprocessed data, getting first results and fine-tuning depending on the results. If network is built appropriately, the time needed should be less than 2 weeks.

*Building an application to present the results:* Application should be simple and used to highlight the power of the build network, so time needed should be around a week.

*Writing the final report:* If all tasks beforehand done properly, this should just be documenting previously done work. Also around a week for the report.

*Preparing the presentation of your work:* To make sure my collegaues understand what I did in my project, creating a understanding presentation is very important. To record a video and create some sort of presentation should take around a week as well.
